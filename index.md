# 🛡️ Endpoint Threat Detection & Response with Splunk + Windows Defender

A hands-on, real-world project that combines **Splunk (Free version)** and **Windows Defender** to simulate and detect attacker behavior using **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**.  
Built for home lab environments and focused on **EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)** visibility.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to detect, visualize, and alert on endpoint-level threats using native Windows logging + Splunk dashboards.

🔍 Core Outcomes:

- Created MITRE-mapped detections  
- Simulated real-world threats (PowerShell, Brute-force, Registry changes)  
- Built a live Splunk dashboard  
- Created custom alerts and documented **detection-to-response flow** ✅  
- Logged detection telemetry and mapped it to MITRE ATT&CK

## 🍀 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Below is a sample MITRE matrix showing mapped techniques based on the telemetry observed from Windows Defender and simulated attacks.
